# Securethy

**Store with ease, Share in peace**

Securethy is a blockchain-based data-sharing platform that provides a secure and user-friendly solution for file authentication and sharing. By utilizing blockchain technology, Securethy ensures the integrity, transparency, and security of all files shared through the platform.

## The Problem Securethy Solves

### 1. Mitigate Phishing Risk
Traditional file-sharing systems are vulnerable to phishing attacks, where unauthorized users may attempt to gain access to sensitive data. Securethy tackles this issue by authenticating files with a unique Content Identifier (CID) and enabling wallet-based user verification. Only verified users with a connected wallet can access shared files, eliminating the risk of phishing attacks.

### 2. Tamper-Proof File Sharing
Securethy ensures that once a file is uploaded, it remains verifiable and protected from tampering. Any modification to the file results in a new CID, allowing for complete transparency and traceability of file ownership and updates. With immutable blockchain records, Securethy guarantees that files are secure and their history is preserved, providing a tamper-proof solution for sensitive data.

## Key Features

- **Wallet-Based Authentication**: Files are accessible only to users who authenticate via MetaMask or similar wallet solutions.
- **Immutable Records**: Each file and its updates are logged on the blockchain, preventing unauthorized changes.
- **Unique Content Identifiers (CIDs)**: Each file is assigned a CID to verify its authenticity and prevent tampering.
- **Seamless File Sharing**: Securely share files with other users by providing access through their wallet addresses.

## Getting Started

1. **Connect your Wallet**: Use MetaMask or a compatible wallet to log in.
2. **Upload Files**: Files are hashed and stored using IPFS, with blockchain ensuring file authenticity.
3. **Secure Sharing**: Share files securely via wallet addresses, ensuring only verified users can access the data.
4. **Track Changes**: Each file update generates a new CID, providing a traceable history of the file.

## Roadmap

- **Premium Features**: Upcoming features include file encryption, audit trails, and guest access write permissions for advanced users.
